## GETTING STARTED!

#### WHAT IS REACT.JS ?

- Dont have to wait for anything to load , dont need to wait for page to reload, in React.
- You can manipulate the HTML structure (DOM) of the page , manipulate what the users see.
- DOM is the representation of HTML in the webpage or application.
- Allows us to change what the users see, without visible request to the server or need to wait for a new HTML page as a response.
- React is a client-side javascript libary. All about building modern, reactiver user interfaces for the web
- Lean and focused component-based UI libary.
- Certain features (e.g.routing), are added via community packages.

- React can be used to control the entire frontend of a web application, even for switiching pages.
- Change what is visible on screen with React.

#### WHY REACT INSTEAD OF "JUST JAVASCRIPT" ?

- Mindre kodelinjer
- Gjør det enklere.
- Declarative, component-focuesed approach

#### WHAT IS SPA:

- Single-Page-Application (SPA), when server only sends one HTML page, thereafter React takes over and control the UI.
- A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server.
- Instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.

- Så når du jobber med React, finnes det kun en index.html som har kun en div med id:root.
- Når du driver å gjør noe interaktivt på siden, f.eks. trykke knapp, navigere til en annen side er det fortsatt SPA. React skriver om siden man er på med ny data.
- Fortsatt samme HTML root.
- Never request a second HTML page, therefor is a Single Page Application.

- Use React summary module at the end to summarize what you learned or to refresh knowledge in the future. Works stand-alone.
