### Understanding File-based Routing & React Server Components

- NextJS uses files & folders to define routes.
- Only files & folders inside the "app" folder are considered!
- App folder: It's this app folder where you set up your different pages that you want to have on your overall website.
- If you in app have file about, you got my-page-com/about.
- If you in app have folder about, and in that have file post-1, you got: my-page.com/blog/post-1.
- page.js : Tells Next.js that you should render a page.
